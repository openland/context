# @openland/context
Easy universal context passing for NodeJS applications.

## Use cases
* Provide context information for logging (user id, email, connection, etc)
* Instrument code for APM (like OpenTracing)
* Security context for operations

## How To Use
Context variables are immutable and you always start to grow your context from `EmptyContext`.
